## What's new?
New changes always appear first.
* June 2017:
  * Added working text dialogs. These can be created using the AGK.dialog module. See examples folder.
  * given menus some sound capabilities. See the menu example for how this is to be done. Also note that sounds do not have to be put into menus.
  * fixed some misc errors related to python3.
## fixes to be implemented
* the 3d sound module still needs to be fixed.
